This collection includes a Tic-Tac-Toe game with both single-player mode, where an AI opponent is powered by the Minimax algorithm, and a multiplayer mode for two users. I also developed a To-Do List application that allows users to add, edit, mark as completed, and delete tasks, with data persistence using localStorage. Another project is a Random Color Generator, which creates random colors with their HEX and RGB values, useful for designers and developers. Additionally, I built a Text Converter, which enables users to format text by converting it to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalizing sentences, making text editing more efficient. My Text-to-Speech Converter leverages the Web Speech API to transform written text into spoken words, enhancing accessibility. I also created a Text Searching & Highlighting tool that allows users to search for specific words within a paragraph and highlights them instantly. Through these projects, I have practiced JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous programming, algorithm implementation, API integration, and localStorage for data persistence. These projects have not only helped me strengthen my JavaScript expertise but have also provided hands-on experience in building practical, interactive applications that solve real-world problems.",
