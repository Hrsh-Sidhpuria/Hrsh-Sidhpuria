              Hi, I am Harsh Sidhpuria, a passionate software developer with a
              solid computer engineering background. I have experience in
              full-stack development with C, C#, Python, JavaScript, and RESTful
              API development.

              My projects include an intuitive campus navigation system and
              real-time emotion detection. With ASP.NET Core, advanced
              algorithms, and teamwork, I work towards the impact and efficiency
              of results.

              Besides coding, I love traveling, reading, and learning new
              technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech world.
